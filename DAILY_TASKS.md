# Consonance's 100 Days of Code Daily Tasks

### *Day 1: Guess My Number!!!* 

The computer randomly generates a number. The user inputs a number, and the computer will tell you if you are too high, or too low. Then you will get to keep guessing until you guess the number.


### *Day 2: Factorial Finder*

The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. You are to write a program that finds the factorial of a number. Solve this  using both loops and recursion.

### *Day 3: Get to know about Git and GitHub.*
Create an account on Github if you don’t have one.
Fork the 100 days of code repo, add an aboutme.md file as written in the README.md and make a PR...
Kindly add Day 1 and Day 2 submissions if you have completed it.

If you have any issues in this task , kindly relay them in the #100daysofcodehelp channel on slack for support


### *Day 4: Check if Palindrome*

Check if the string entered by a user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar” or yesterday => "7102017".

### *Day 5: Count Vowels*

Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found in a long text.

### *Day 6: Count Letters in a Speech*

Attached is a text file containing the farewell speech of Barack Obama. The function should read content from the file, count and record all letters of the alphabet present. Output should be like => a: 20, b: 10, ...z: 5. It should also be case insensitive i.e 'a' == 'A'.
Link for the text file => http://bit.ly/2yB3keV

### *Day 7: Ordered words*

An ordered word is a word in which the letters appear in
alphabetic order. Take the user input, and order the letters in the word or
sentence alphabetically.

### *Day 9: Alarm Clock Extended*

Alarm Clock Extended - complete the alarm clock challenge if you haven't .......If you have, try and assist at least two people on the slack team to do so

### *Day 10: Calculator*

Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators(addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Make it a scientific calculator(sin, cos, etc) for added complexity.

### *Day 11: GPA Calculator*

GPA Calculator: Get the courses, units and scores from a user and determine the GPA
using a 5 point grade system.

### *Day 12: GPA Calculator*

GPA Calculator: Finish up GPA calculator, help other team mates having issues building theirs

### *Day 13: Temperature converter*

Temperature converter - Program should convert temperature in degree Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

### *Day 14: Random Quote Machine*

Random Quote Machine - Program should print out quotes that have been stored randomly. You don't need to use any API. Store some quotes in your program and print one at random each time the program executes.

### *Day 15: Address Book*

Address Book - Create a program that prompts the user for the information in most address books (Contact name and phone number) and then stores it in a .txt file! The program should also display the contacts that have been stored in the text file

### *Day 16: Password generator*

Password generator: Create a password generation program which will generate passwords
containing random ASCII characters from the following groups: lower-case letters, upper-case
letters. For added complexity add special characters like "*?^&%$#@+=".

### *Day 17: Mail app*

Mail App - Make an application that takes in the necessary data(recipient email address, sender's email address, message) for sending a mail and sends it!

### *Day 18: Hello GUI!*

Hello GUI - Get familiar with how GUI apps are made with your preferred programming language. Play with common UI components such as buttons, text boxes, labels, etc. Make a GUI app that displays "Hello GUI" once launched.

### *Day 19: (Temperature Converter)++*

(Temperature Converter)++ - Build a GUI version of the temperature converter built on Day 13. Time to test your GUI skills!!!

### *Day 20: Quiz Maker*:

Quiz Maker - Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students and grades them.


### *Day 21: Calculator GUI*

Calculator GUI - Build a GUI version of the calculator built on Day 10. Try and give it a nice UI.

### *Day 22: Address Book GUI*

Address Book GUI - Build a GUI version of the address book built on Day 15. Try storing more information like contact email address, birthday.

### *Day 23: Password Generator GUI*

Password Generator GUI - Build a GUI version of the Password Generator built on Day 16. The apps should be able to generate easy, medium, hard passwords. For now the difficulty of the passwords should depend on the length i.e a hard password can have 10 characters, medium password 7 characters, easy password 4 characters....

### *Day 24: Mail app GUI*

Mail App GUI - Build a GUI version of the Mail App built on Day 17. Add more features like sending to multiple email addresses, adding a subject for the mail to be sent.   

### *Day 25: Coin Flip Simulation* 

Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

### *Day 26: Find Pi to the Nth Digit*

Find Pi to the Nth Digit - Develop a program that has the user enter a number. Your program should print out Pi up to that many decimal places. Try to keep a limit as to how far the program will go.

### * Day 27 :  Mortgage Calculator *

Develop a program that calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also, figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan.

*Bonus*
_For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually)._


### *Day 28-30: APIs Intro*

*APIs Intro* - Take out time to read about APIs and how they can be used with your programming language. Examples of APIs include Github API, Twitter's API, etc.

### *Day 31: Dog Images*

*Dog Images* - It's time to try out our new found skills in working with APIs. Head over to https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ and go through their API docs. Build an app that returns a random image of a dog each time it is run. For added complexity, make a GUI app with a button. Each time the button is clicked, the image should be shown on the screen

### *Day 32: (Dog Images)++*

(Dog Images)++ - We worked with generating random images on Day 31. This time your app(GUI) should be able to return images based on the breed of dog entered by a user. 

### *Day 33: Dictionary App*

Dictionary App - We are still in our API series.This time we will work with an API that requires authentication(api keys). Build a dictionary app that takes in text from the user and returns the meaning of the text using the Oxford dictionaries API. Head over to => https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/ , create an account and go through the API docs.

### *Day 34: (Dictionary App)++*

(Dictionary App)++ - This time you are to build upon the Dictionary App built on Day 33. Instead of just returning the meaning of words entered by the user, the app should also return synonyms and antonyms of the word. 

### *Day 35: Chuck Norris Jokes*
*Chuck Norris Jokes* - Your app should display a random Chuck Norris joke once prompted by the user. Go through the api documentation => http://www.icndb.com/api/

### *Day 36: Get gifs by text entered*
