# Consonance's 100 Days of Code Daily Tasks

### *Day 1: Guess My Number!!!* 

The computer randomly generates a number. The user inputs a number, and the computer will tell you if you are too high, or too low. Then you will get to keep guessing until you guess the number.


### *Day 2: Factorial Finder*

The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. You are to write a program that finds the factorial of a number. Solve this  using both loops and recursion.

### *Day 3: Get to know about Git and GitHub.*
Create an account on Github if you don’t have one.
Fork the 100 days of code repo, add an aboutme.md file as written in the README.md and make a PR...
Kindly add Day 1 and Day 2 submissions if you have completed it.

If you have any issues in this task , kindly relay them in the #100daysofcodehelp channel on slack for support


### *Day 4: Check if Palindrome*

Check if the string entered by a user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar” or yesterday => "7102017".

### *Day 5: Count Vowels*

Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found in a long text.

### *Day 6: Count Letters in a Speech*

Attached is a text file containing the farewell speech of Barack Obama. The function should read content from the file, count and record all letters of the alphabet present. Output should be like => a: 20, b: 10, ...z: 5. It should also be case insensitive i.e 'a' == 'A'.
Link for the text file => http://bit.ly/2yB3keV

### *Day 7: Ordered words*

An ordered word is a word in which the letters appear in
alphabetic order. Take the user input, and order the letters in the word or
sentence alphabetically.

### *Day 8: Alarm Clock*

Alarm Clock - Build a simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time set.

### *Day 9: Alarm Clock Extended*

Alarm Clock Extended - complete the alarm clock challenge if you haven't .......If you have, try and assist at least two people on the slack team to do so

### *Day 10: Calculator*

Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators(addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Make it a scientific calculator(sin, cos, etc) for added complexity.

### *Day 11: GPA Calculator*

GPA Calculator: Get the courses, units and scores from a user and determine the GPA
using a 5 point grade system.

### *Day 12: GPA Calculator*

GPA Calculator: Finish up GPA calculator, help other team mates having issues building theirs

### *Day 13: Temperature converter*

Temperature converter - Program should convert temperature in degree Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

### *Day 14: Random Quote Machine*

Random Quote Machine - Program should print out quotes that have been stored randomly. You don't need to use any API. Store some quotes in your program and print one at random each time the program executes.

### *Day 15: Address Book*

Address Book - Create a program that prompts the user for the information in most address books (Contact name and phone number) and then stores it in a .txt file! The program should also display the contacts that have been stored in the text file

### *Day 16: Password generator*

Password generator: Create a password generation program which will generate passwords
containing random ASCII characters from the following groups: lower-case letters, upper-case
letters. For added complexity add special characters like "*?^&%$#@+=".

### *Day 17: Mail app*

Mail App - Make an application that takes in the necessary data(recipient email address, sender's email address, message) for sending a mail and sends it!

### *Day 18: Hello GUI!*

Hello GUI - Get familiar with how GUI apps are made with your preferred programming language. Play with common UI components such as buttons, text boxes, labels, etc. Make a GUI app that displays "Hello GUI" once launched.

### *Day 19: (Temperature Converter)++*

(Temperature Converter)++ - Build a GUI version of the temperature converter built on Day 13. Time to test your GUI skills!!!

### *Day 20: Quiz Maker*:

Quiz Maker - Make an application which takes various questions from a file, picked randomly, and puts together a quiz for students and grades them.


### *Day 21: Calculator GUI*
