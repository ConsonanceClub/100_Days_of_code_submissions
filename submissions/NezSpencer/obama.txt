Full Text: President Obama's farewell speech
Itâ€™s good to be home. My fellow Americans, Michelle and I have been so touched by all the
well-wishes weâ€™ve received over the past few weeks. But tonight itâ€™s my turn to say thanks.
Whether weâ€™ve seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all, my conversations with you, the American
people â€“ in living rooms and schools; at farms and on factory floors; at diners and on distant
outposts â€“ are what have kept me honest, kept me inspired, and kept me going. Every day, I
learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man.
I first came to Chicago when I was in my early 20s, still trying to figure out who I was; still
searching for a purpose to my life. It was in neighborhoods not far from here where I began
working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel mills. It was on these streets where I
witnessed the power of faith, and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and
loss. This is where I learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved, get
engaged, and come together to demand it.

After eight years as your president, I still believe that. And itâ€™s not just my belief. Itâ€™s the
beating heart of our American idea â€“ our bold experiment in self-government.
Itâ€™s the conviction that we are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain unalienable
rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Itâ€™s the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing; that we,
the people, through the instrument of our democracy, can form a more perfect union.
This is the great gift our Founders gave us. The freedom to chase our individual dreams through
our sweat, toil, and imagination â€“ and the imperative to strive together as well, to achieve a
greater good.

For 240 years, our nationâ€™s call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new
generation. Itâ€™s what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny, pioneers to trek west, slaves to
brave that makeshift railroad to freedom. Itâ€™s what pulled immigrants and refugees across
oceans and the Rio Grande, pushed women to reach for the ballot, powered workers to organize.
Itâ€™s why GIs gave their lives at Omaha Beach and Iwo Jima; Iraq and Afghanistan â€“ and why
men and women from Selma to Stonewall were prepared to give theirs as well.
So thatâ€™s what we mean when we say America is exceptional. Not that our nation has been
flawless from the start, but that we have shown the capacity to change, and make life better for
those who follow.

Yes, our progress has been uneven. The work of democracy has always been hard, contentious
and sometimes bloody. For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back. But
the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our
founding creed to embrace all, and not just some. 
If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto
industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our historyâ€¦if I had told you that we
would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iranâ€™s nuclear weapons program
without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11â€¦if I had told you that we would win
marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow
citizens â€“ you might have said our sights were set a little too high.
But thatâ€™s what we did. Thatâ€™s what you did. You were the change. You answered peopleâ€™s
hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it
was when we started.

In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power
from one freely elected president to the next. I committed to President-elect Trump that my
administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.
Because itâ€™s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges
we still face.

We have what we need to do so. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most
respected nation on Earth. Our youth and drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless
capacity for risk and reinvention mean that the future should be ours.
But that potential will be realized only if our democracy works. Only if our politics reflects the
decency of the our people. Only if all of us, regardless of our party affiliation or particular
interest, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.
Thatâ€™s what I want to focus on tonight â€“ the state of our democracy.
Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders quarreled and compromised,
and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of
solidarity â€“ the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or
fall as one.

There have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity. The
beginning of this century has been one of those times. A shrinking world, growing inequality;
demographic change and the specter of terrorism â€“ these forces havenâ€™t just tested our security
and prosperity, but our democracy as well. And how we meet these challenges to our democracy
will determine our ability to educate our kids, and create good jobs, and protect our homeland.
In other words, it will determine our future.
Our democracy wonâ€™t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity. Today, the
economy is growing again; wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are rising
again; poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock
market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a 10-year low. The uninsured rate has
never, ever been lower. Healthcare costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years. And if anyone 
can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements weâ€™ve made to our
healthcare system â€“ that covers as many people at less cost â€“ I will publicly support it.
That, after all, is why we serve â€“ to make peopleâ€™s lives better, not worse.
But for all the real progress weâ€™ve made, we know itâ€™s not enough. Our economy doesnâ€™t work
as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class. But stark
inequality is also corrosive to our democratic principles. While the top 1% has amassed a bigger
share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and rural counties, have been left
behind â€“ the laid-off factory worker; the waitress and healthcare worker who struggle to pay the
bills â€“ convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their government only serves the
interests of the powerful â€“ a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics.
There are no quick fixes to this long-term trend. I agree that our trade should be fair and not just
free. But the next wave of economic dislocation wonâ€™t come from overseas. It will come from
the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.
And so we must forge a new social compact â€“ to guarantee all our kids the education they need;
to give workers the power to unionize for better wages; to update the social safety net to reflect
the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and individuals who
reap the most from the new economy donâ€™t avoid their obligations to the country thatâ€™s made
their success possible. We can argue about how to best achieve these goals. But we canâ€™t be
complacent about the goals themselves. For if we donâ€™t create opportunity for all people, the
disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.
Thereâ€™s a second threat to our democracy â€“ one as old as our nation itself. After my election,
there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never
realistic. For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. Iâ€™ve lived long
enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or 30 years ago â€“ you can
see it not just in statistics, but in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.
But weâ€™re not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every
economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hard-working white middle class and
undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the
wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of
immigrants, just because they donâ€™t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children â€“
because those brown kids will represent a larger share of Americaâ€™s workforce. And our
economy doesnâ€™t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age
groups, for men and for women.

Going forward, we must uphold laws against discrimination â€“ in hiring, in housing, in education
and the criminal justice system. Thatâ€™s what our Constitution and highest ideals require. But
laws alone wonâ€™t be enough. Hearts must change. If our democracy is to work in this
increasingly diverse nation, each one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great
characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said, â€œYou never really understand a person 
until you consider things from his point of viewâ€¦until you climb into his skin and walk around
in it.â€

For blacks and other minorities, it means tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges
that a lot of people in this country face â€“ the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the
transgender American, and also the middle-aged white man who from the outside may seem like
heâ€™s got all the advantages, but whoâ€™s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and
technological change.

For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didnâ€™t
suddenly vanish in the â€˜60s; that when minority groups voice discontent, theyâ€™re not just
engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; that when they wage peaceful
protest, theyâ€™re not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our Founders promised.
For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants
today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, Italians, and Poles. America wasnâ€™t
weakened by the presence of these newcomers; they embraced this nationâ€™s creed, and it was
strengthened.

So regardless of the station we occupy; we have to try harder; to start with the premise that each
of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and
family like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our
own.

None of this is easy. For too many of us, itâ€™s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles,
whether in our neighborhoods or college campuses or places of worship or our social media
feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never
challenge our assumptions. The rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional
stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste â€“ all this makes this great
sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that
we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our
opinions on the evidence thatâ€™s out there.

This trend represents a third threat to our democracy. Politics is a battle of ideas; in the course of
a healthy debate, weâ€™ll prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But
without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and
concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, weâ€™ll keep
talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible.
Isnâ€™t that part of what makes politics so dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits
when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when weâ€™re cutting taxes for
corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other
party does the same thing? Itâ€™s not just dishonest, this selective sorting of the facts; itâ€™s selfdefeating.
Because as my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you. 
Take the challenge of climate change. In just eight years, weâ€™ve halved our dependence on
foreign oil, doubled our renewable energy, and led the world to an agreement that has the
promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children wonâ€™t have time to debate
the existence of climate change; theyâ€™ll be busy dealing with its effects: environmental disasters,
economic disruptions, and waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.

Now, we can and should argue about the best approach to the problem. But to simply deny the
problem not only betrays future generations; it betrays the essential spirit of innovation and
practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.

Itâ€™s that spirit, born of the Enlightenment, that made us an economic powerhouse â€“ the spirit that
took flight at Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral; the spirit that that cures disease and put a
computer in every pocket.

Itâ€™s that spirit â€“ a faith in reason, and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might, that
allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression, and build a
post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or
national affiliations but on principles â€“ the rule of law, human rights, freedoms of religion,
speech, assembly, and an independent press.

That order is now being challenged â€“ first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for Islam; more
recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who see free markets, open democracies, and civil
society itself as a threat to their power. The peril each poses to our democracy is more farreaching
than a car bomb or a missile. It represents the fear of change; the fear of people who
look or speak or pray differently; a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable;
an intolerance of dissent and free thought; a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or
propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of whatâ€™s true and whatâ€™s right.
Because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform, and the intelligence
officers, law enforcement, and diplomats who support them, no foreign terrorist organization has
successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years; and
although Boston and Orlando remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law
enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. Weâ€™ve taken out tens of
thousands of terrorists â€“ including Osama bin Laden. The global coalition weâ€™re leading against
ISIL has taken out their leaders, and taken away about half their territory. ISIL will be
destroyed, and no one who threatens America will ever be safe. To all who serve, it has been the
honor of my lifetime to be your Commander-in-Chief.

But protecting our way of life requires more than our military. Democracy can buckle when we
give in to fear. So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we
must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. Thatâ€™s why, for the past
eight years, Iâ€™ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. Thatâ€™s why
weâ€™ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to
protect privacy and civil liberties. Thatâ€™s why I reject discrimination against Muslim Americans.
Thatâ€™s why we cannot withdraw from global fights â€“ to expand democracy, and human rights,
womenâ€™s rights, and LGBT rights â€“ no matter how imperfect our efforts, no matter how 
expedient ignoring such values may seem. For the fight against extremism and intolerance and
sectarianism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression. If
the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world, the likelihood of
war within and between nations increases, and our own freedoms will eventually be threatened.
So letâ€™s be vigilant, but not afraid. ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat
America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or
China cannot match our influence around the world â€“ unless we give up what we stand for, and
turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.
Which brings me to my final point â€“ our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for
granted. All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our
democratic institutions. When voting rates are some of the lowest among advanced democracies,
we should make it easier, not harder, to vote. When trust in our institutions is low, we should
reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of
transparency and ethics in public service. When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our
districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.
And all of this depends on our participation; on each of us accepting the responsibility of
citizenship, regardless of which way the pendulum of power swings.

Our Constitution is a remarkable, beautiful gift. But itâ€™s really just a piece of parchment. It has
no power on its own. We, the people, give it power â€“ with our participation, and the choices we
make. Whether or not we stand up for our freedoms. Whether or not we respect and enforce the
rule of law. America is no fragile thing. But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not
assured.

In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning
of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but â€œfrom different causes and from different quarters much
pains will be takenâ€¦to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth;â€ that we should
preserve it with â€œjealous anxiety;â€ that we should reject â€œthe first dawning of every attempt to
alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tiesâ€ that make us one.
We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people
of good character are turned off from public service; so coarse with rancor that Americans with
whom we disagree are not just misguided, but somehow malevolent. We weaken those ties
when we define some of us as more American than others; when we write off the whole system
as inevitably corrupt, and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing
them.

It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the
joyous task weâ€™ve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Because for
all our outward differences, we all share the same proud title: Citizen.
Ultimately, thatâ€™s what our democracy demands. It needs you. Not just when thereâ€™s an
election, not just when your own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime. 
If youâ€™re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try to talk with one in real life. If
something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If youâ€™re disappointed by
your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show
up. Dive in. Persevere. Sometimes youâ€™ll win. Sometimes youâ€™ll lose. Presuming a reservoir
of goodness in others can be a risk, and there will be times when the process disappoints you.
But for those of us fortunate enough to have been a part of this work, to see it up close, let me
tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America â€“ and in
Americans â€“ will be confirmed.

Mine sure has been. Over the course of these eight years, Iâ€™ve seen the hopeful faces of young
graduates and our newest military officers. Iâ€™ve mourned with grieving families searching for
answers, and found grace in a Charleston church. Iâ€™ve seen our scientists help a paralyzed man
regain his sense of touch, and our wounded warriors walk again. Iâ€™ve seen our doctors and
volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks. Iâ€™ve seen the youngest
of children remind us of our obligations to care for refugees, to work in peace, and above all to
look out for each other.

That faith I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to
bring about change â€“ that faith has been rewarded in ways I couldnâ€™t possibly have imagined. I
hope yours has, too. Some of you here tonight or watching at home were there with us in 2004,
in 2008, in 2012 â€“ and maybe you still canâ€™t believe we pulled this whole thing off.
Youâ€™re not the only ones. Michelle â€“ for the past 25 years, youâ€™ve been not only my wife and
mother of my children, but my best friend. You took on a role you didnâ€™t ask for and made it
your own with grace and grit and style and good humor. You made the White House a place that
belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role
model. Youâ€™ve made me proud. Youâ€™ve made the country proud.
Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young
women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You
wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that Iâ€™ve done in my life, Iâ€™m most
proud to be your dad.

To Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delawareâ€™s favorite son: You were
the first choice I made as a nominee, and the best. Not just because you have been a great vice
president, but because in the bargain, I gained a brother. We love you and Jill like family, and
your friendship has been one of the great joys of our life.

To my remarkable staff: For eight years â€“ and for some of you, a whole lot more â€“ Iâ€™ve drawn
from your energy, and tried to reflect back what you displayed every day: heart, and character,
and idealism. Iâ€™ve watched you grow up, get married, have kids, and start incredible new
journeys of your own. Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get
the better of you. The only thing that makes me prouder than all the good weâ€™ve done is the
thought of all the remarkable things youâ€™ll achieve from here. 

And to all of you out there â€“ every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town and kind family
who welcomed them in, every volunteer who knocked on doors, every young person who cast a
ballot for the first time, every American who lived and breathed the hard work of change â€“ you
are the best supporters and organizers anyone could hope for, and I will forever be grateful.
Because, yes, you changed the world.

Thatâ€™s why I leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than I was when we
started. Because I know our work has not only helped so many Americans; it has inspired so
many Americans â€“ especially so many young people out there â€“ to believe you can make a
difference; to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselves. This generation coming up
â€“ unselfish, altruistic, creative, patriotic â€“ Iâ€™ve seen you in every corner of the country. You
believe in a fair, just, inclusive America; you know that constant change has been Americaâ€™s
hallmark, something not to fear but to embrace, and you are willing to carry this hard work of
democracy forward. Youâ€™ll soon outnumber any of us, and I believe as a result that the future is
in good hands.

My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I wonâ€™t stop; in fact, I will
be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain. For now, whether youâ€™re young
or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president â€“ the same thing I asked when
you took a chance on me eight years ago.

I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change â€“ but in yours.
I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea
whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those
who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign
battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not
yet written:

Yes We Can.
Yes We Did.
Yes We Can.

Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.
