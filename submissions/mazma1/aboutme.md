## First of all, Introduction!

My name is **Mary Mazi**, a graduate of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Federal University of Technology Owerri. I found love in software engineering and development and I've pitched my tent here for good.

## So I write:
**Javascript** ðŸ’— majorly, **PHP** and a little **Python**. I need to brush up my PHP and Python though, I've gotten quite rusty with them.
