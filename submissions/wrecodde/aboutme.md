Hi, I'm Deji Joseph. But, do call me Deji.
My screen name, wrecodde, is pronounced recode, should you feel inclined to mention it.

I write. Code too. In the language of the Python.
Movies, books, talks and games. And good music.

Fav emoji? That'd be the :slightly_smiling_face: and :sunglasses: emojis. Maybe the :+1:.. I can't say I have a fave now. Can I?
