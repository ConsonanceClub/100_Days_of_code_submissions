Hello!, my name is Hanifah Bhadmus but most people call me anie or hanie( u're free to pick any!). 
I am a currently a student of the University Of Lagos, Nigeria and my major is Systems Engineering.
I love the challenge software development presents and love the feeling i get when my code runs and does what i want it to,
although i guess the head-scratching moments when your code is failing some tests is part of it too.
I am currently learning web related technologies such as Asp.net mvc in addition to javascript.
Hoping to learn a few javascript frameworks before the year runs out, currently i code primarily using C#.
I hope to get involved in A.I and Machine Learning later on but for now i'm participating in the 100 days of code to sharpen my C# skills.
