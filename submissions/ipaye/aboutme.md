# Brief Introduction

My name is **Ipaye Alameen**, im a computer engineering student of the university of lagos, currently in my 4th year, i love to code in Javascript and i like to think of myself as a **NERD**.

# Talk about Coding

Well, i write **Javascript** 💗 majorly, and i strongly dislike **PHP** for now.

# Favourite Emoji

I really cant choose anyone right now because that would be cheating, i love them all equally but if i was to choose, id go with 🦄, you just dont see that everyday 😆.
